    <p>This year, in combination with my <a href=/masterarabic>publishing</a> a book about getting from intermediate-advanced level in Arabic, I wanted to find a way to stay committed to improving my own language. So I've started <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ma-wara-al-logha">a mostly-Arabic-only podcast</a>.</p>

    <p>There are two episodes up already, both from the 'Jordanian Dialect' series. This series is recorded with co-host Lina Obeidat, my good friend and Arabic teacher of several years. (Book lessons with Lina <a href="https://www.italki.com/teacher/1139916">on iTalki here</a>. She's also a regular contributor to <a href="http://www.talkinarabic.com/">talkinarabic.com's Levantine materials</a>).</p>

    <p>During the first episode, we talked about the winter and the rain in Jordan (where we're both based), and I learnt about the existence of a period of 40 days when the weather is much colder. In our second episode, we talked about taxis in Amman. We struggled to find many positive things to say about the system or the drivers of taxis, but tried to see things from their perspective. At the end, I learned a new proverb that was appropriate to our discussion.</p>

    <p>In the coming weeks I'll be adding more shows to the podcast. There will be a show focusing on Classical Arabic texts. There will be a show on Modern Literature. Potentially we'll have a show for Egyptian Colloquial (sigh!) but that depends on my finding someone to host it (<a href="https://incrementalelephant.org/contact/">let me know</a> if you're interested).</p>

    <p>I'm looking forward to recording more episodes. Please leave a comment over on Soundcloud with any feedback you might have.
