# Language Coach

An application to help intermediate-advanced language students pick what to study.

The main project files (so far) are in the root directory.
* `languagecoach.py` is the main application
* `lc-setup.sql` is the database setup file
* The `myapp` folder is where the vagrant virtual machine is located
* (`djangogirls` is where I keep the files for a Django tutorial I started going through)
