# Language Coach

Source files for the [languagecoach.io](http://www.languagecoach.io)
website.

Includes an application to help intermediate-advanced language
students pick what to study called *CoachBot*.

This application was originally implemented as a Python/Flask app, but
in March 2020 was converted to Ruby/Sinatra.
