        <p>You&#8217;re an Arabic student, and after months and years of studying, you&#8217;re finally able to come up with the correct <em>i&#8217;raab</em> in your sleep and write flowing, cohesive essays. But you feel like you&#8217;ve hit a roadblock: You know enough Arabic to read a newspaper, but not to find out who made the final goal in last night&#8217;s football match. You can laugh at a joke in Arabic, but lack the skills to reply.</p>

        <p>&#8216;Master Arabic&#8217; is for you. This is a resource for intermediate-level Arabic learners who are looking to progress in the language in an engaging, simple way that doesn&#8217;t require going back to school or starting from scratch. &#8216;Master Arabic&#8217; will take your Arabic to the next level: It features tried-and-tested resources and techniques and practical advice on how to improve your reading, writing, speaking and listening skills. It shows how to make these improvements while retaining time to have a life outside language study. &#8216;Master Arabic&#8217; comprises everything from productivity advice to recommendations for tools to improve specific skills.</p>

        <p>&#8216;Master Arabic&#8217; is available as a premium package that includes over a dozen interviews with leading educators, Arabists and students from Jordan, Egypt and the United States, who impart their secrets on how to pass through to advanced materials.<br/></p>
        
        <p>I designed Master Arabic as an outcome of my experiences learning Arabic and languages such as Dari, Persian and Pashto. Over the past decade, I&#8217;ve had everything from a conventional, university-level language education to an immersive language learning experience and self-taught myself everything from Japanese Kanji to basic Urdu.</p>

        <p>I studied Arabic at university, but my skills had begun to atrophy over the years while I focused on other languages. I was like you - stuck at one level. I dove back into Arabic, using study methods and advice from language-learning experts that have helped make me reach almost native fluency. This resource offers everything I&#8217;ve learnt and much more: it has insights from Arabic teaching professionals who&#8217;ve experimented with methods and hit on winning formulas, students who&#8217;ve developed interesting ways of practicing Arabic, and the best of the learnings from the polyglot community.</p>

        <p>As a coach for language learning methods, I&#8217;m aware of the challenges faced by everyone from language students to professionals who need to learn a language to succeed at work. I&#8217;m confident that this resource will help you excel at Arabic, and that together, we can finally master this wonderful language.</p>
