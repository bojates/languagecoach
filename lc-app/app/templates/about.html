        <h1 align='center'>About Alex</h1><br>
        <div>
        <p>I grew up learning French, German, Latin, and Greek, and did a BA in Arabic and Persian at the School of Oriental and African Studies. As part of my degree, I studied Arabic at Damascus University in 2005&#8211;6.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated with the different ways that one can work, think and study, so these come together in how I approach languages. Even though I studied languages at university in a full-time programme, I wanted to go beyond just learning on your own from books and figure out new ways of improving my language skills.</p>

        <p>I came to Afghanistan as a tourist in 2004, where I had to grapple with Pashto, a language for which there were no useful textbooks or study materials at the time. This sparked my journey into self learning: I started going through language forums to learn about new methods, and started observing the language from daily conversations. Over the years, I&#8217;ve learned, honed and tried a variety of methods and techniques about linguistics and memory. Now I'm comfortable in several languages and I've managed to figure out some things that really work.</p>

        <p>My language skills informed my work and research in Afghanistan, culminating in widely renowned books. I co-edited <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Taliban-Abdul-Salam-Zaeef-ebook/dp/B00GGMT9ZS/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?sr=8-1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=my%2Blife%2Bwith%2Bthe%2Btaliban&amp;tag=soumet-20&amp;qid=1483348949">the memoir</a> of the former Taliban envoy to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, published by Hurst and Columbia University Press to critical acclaim in 2010; a history of the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda entitled '<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enemy-We-Created-Taliban-Al-Afghanistan-ebook/dp/B008PPWB18/ref=pd_sim_351_4?refRID=96XMPJHV76G8N99DJCHW&amp;tag=soumet-20&amp;psc=1&amp;_encoding=UTF8">An Enemy We Created: The Myth of the Taliban - Al-Qaeda Merger, 1970&#8211;2010</a>'; and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Poetry-Taliban-Alex-Strick-Linschoten/dp/1849041113/ref=sr_1_cc_1?ie=UTF8&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;s=aps&amp;keywords=poetry%2Btaliban&amp;tag=soumet-20&amp;qid=1483349005">Poetry of the Taliban</a>, a volume of poetry written by Taliban members, published by Hurst (UK).</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve worked as a freelance journalist from Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon and Somalia, writing for Foreign Policy, International Affairs, ABC Nyheter, The Sunday Times and The Globe and Mail. I co-host the <a href="https://www.sourcesandmethods.com">Sources and Methods podcast</a> with researcher Matt Trevithick, where we talk to interesting people doing interesting things get to talk about the what, how and why of what they do.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve traveled, lived in, and spent extended periods of time in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Bosnia, Australia, Somalia, and across the Middle East and Europe.</p>

        <p>In 2015, I decided to advance my Arabic, which had started to atrophy because of my years in Afghanistan working in Pashto and Dari. I spent nearly six months to get back into the language, using a mix of methods and approaches, from spaced repetition to online tutoring. I received a Kathryn Davis fellowship to study Arabic at Middlebury College&#8217;s Intensive Summer Language Program in the U.S., and was placed at the highest level in the programme.</p>

        <p>In 2016, I successfully defended my PhD at the War Studies Department of King's College London. I currently live in Jordan, where I am continuing my study of Arabic, and host <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ma-wara-al-logha">an Arabic podcast</a>.</p>

        <p>I&#8217;ve used memory techniques to learn Japanese, and to memorise Kanji. I currently speak English, Arabic, French, German, Dutch, Persian, Dari and Pashto.</p>
