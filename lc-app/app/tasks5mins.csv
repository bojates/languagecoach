"Call up a shop to ask them if they're open","Find the number of a random shop in the country that speaks the language you're learning. (TIP: Use something like Yelp to find a number). Call them up on your phone (or using Skype) and ask them if they're open. Bonus: if they are open, find out when they close. Say thank you and end the call."
"Translate something from social media","Go on Twitter or Facebook and find a single tweet or post. Translate it into English and post the translation with a link to the original."

"Book an iTalki session","Half of the challenge learning to speak a language is getting over the fear of actually talking to someone else. So head over to iTalki to book a session right now. It'll take a few minutes to pick a time, so this is time well spent."
"Record a video of yourself speaking your language","Pick a topic, perhaps from this list (iteslj.org/questions/), and record yourself talking about that topic for 3 or 4 minutes.

"Write today's to-do list using pen/paper","Write down the list of things you need to get done today, only instead of using your mother tongue language, use the language you're studying. If you need to look up any words, do so quickly. Try to finish writing up the list (in some shape or form) within the 5 minutes allocated."
"Describe the room in which you're sitting","Talk out loud - to yourself, or whoever you're sitting with - and describe all the different objects, colours and features of the room or location in which you're sitting.

BONUS: Make a note of any words you'd like to look up in a dictionary."
"Correct a short post or two on Lang-8","Lang-8 is a site where you can get corrections on things you write.

Correct someone else's entry now and you'll get more corrections of your own."

"Listen to a poem being recited","Find a poem being recited in your target language. YouTube is probably the best place to find these. Try to understand the gist of the poem. Bear in mind that poetry is much harder to understand than prose, so don't worry if you find this hard."
"Learn a proverb / saying","Find a proverb or saying in your target language. Textbooks or online sites are good places to find these. Figure out the translation and then learn that proverb. BONUS: Think about contexts, situations or conversations where you might be able to use this saying."
"Brainstorm connect words","Think of a starter word or topic (anything will do). Write that word or topic in the centre of a blank piece of paper. Then write related / connected words on the rest of the paper. Connect them together with lines like on a mindmap. Use only your target language."
"Get some vocabulary context","Think of a random word or connector particle or verb in your target language.

"Translate a Restaurant Menu","Search the web for online restaurant menus in Arabic. (If you can't find any, use the Arabic sub-site of https://ifood.jo/ for suggestions). Go through the menu and translate all the different foods. BONUS: Write down your translations of the menu into English, then close the website and try to translate the text back into Arabic."

"Describing making a salad","Describe all the steps you need to carry out to make a salad. Don't skimp on the description.
